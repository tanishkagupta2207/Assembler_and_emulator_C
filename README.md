# Assembler_and_emulator_C++
A assembler and an emulator's code written in C++ language to support a predefined assembly language 


# ASSEMBLER PART: 
	
	-> Uses a single process/routine for both passes
	-> Diagnoses Label errors(nomenclature,duplicate, missing etc)
	-> Produces Listing file 
	-> Uses C++ Map for storing instruction names
	-> Implements and demonstrates the instruction SET

# Emulator Part:
	
  	->Runs on the machine code generated by the assembler 
	->Loads Object File
	->Produces Memory Dump
