# Assembler_and_emulator_C++
A assembler and an emulator's code written in C++ language to support a predefined assembly language.
Custom Language that is used for is provided in the pdf.


# ASSEMBLER PART: 
	
	-> Uses a single process/routine for both passes
	-> Diagnoses Label errors(nomenclature,duplicate, missing etc)
	-> Produces Listing file 
	-> Uses C++ Map for storing instruction names
	-> Implements and demonstrates the instruction SET

# Emulator Part:
	
  	->Runs on the machine code generated by the assembler 
	->Loads Object File
	->Produces Memory Dump

# Testing

	->Some basic tests are already given
 	->For testing add the asm.cpp and emu.cpp file in the same folder as the test code 
  	->Change the filename parameter in asm.cpp to desired test file
   	->emulator will only work after assembler has already been run on the code and the machine code is available for the same
