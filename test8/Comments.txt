Comments on Test8:

-> Program returns the address of the searched no. from memory if present otherwise returns -1
-> here all no. are stored one by one starting from memory location 5
-> Searched no. is stored on memory location 6
-> Reg_a is finalized as 6 after completion of code proving code's correctness
